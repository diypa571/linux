# Web Server Monitoring Script

This bash script allows you to monitor the status of a web server and track system information at regular intervals.
It periodically checks the web server's availability by sending an HTTP request and displays the server's status.
Additionally, it provides CPU and memory usage information of the system.



Feel free to customize the script further based on your specific monitoring requirements.
